            When my teammates and I met with Collaborate.biz the client was very forthcoming. He had been working on his concept for 2 years and the vision had changed a few times. Collaborate.biz pairs small business owners with each other to gain access to new clients and larger projects. The current state of the MVP focused on gathering information crucial to a good B2B match.
          </p>
          <p>
            The client wanted to set his product apart by providing quality matches based on a wider set of criteria. He needed to know what outcomes a user considered a good return on time invested, how he could foster continued and frequent engagement with the platform and whether or not users were interested in finding specific collaboration projects on the platform.

            Before delving into user research we looked at the current state of the project. In our initial assessment of Collaborate.biz we theorized that the onboarding might be too long.

            It takes a lot of information to get a picture of how a business aligns with another, but a long scrolling list of text fields and inputs is off-putting. I was skeptical that users would take part without seeing examples of business matches. We assumed users would want to judge the quality of matches for themselves.

              Our interview questions focused on the challenges small business owners face. We were interested in learning about the criteria they consider when seeking to collaborate with other businesses, identify pitfalls of collaboration, and discover how businesses currently form partnerships.

              For small business owners, reputation is everything. A bad collaboration can ruin what took years to build. A good collaboration is hard to assess making in-depth vetting the only way to mitigate possible risk to reputation.

              Owners must have faith in the people involved to represent each other. A good understanding of the other business’ working style, process and product is key.

          After our SME interviews we wondered about how time strapped businesses vetted others. It was time to analyze the competition and learn about current solutions. We looked at nine of the most prominent competitors, including a few the client identified as being successful. For the most part, the competitors sat on two ends, let’s call them a high and low end.

              We put together our interview guide and talked with four small business owners: a tax consultant, personal chef, leadership consultant and an insurance agent.
            </p>
            <p>
              The consultants were most concerned with vetting other businesses. They had high-value clientele that demanded a spotless reputation and could pay for it. Consultants were less concerned with finding clients than they were growing their businesses. They researched other businesses through personal connections and online investigations. The consultants were also active in their communities and had a strong desire to help other business owners develop.
            </p>
            <p>
              The personal chef and insurance agent had different goals from the consultants. They thought of collaboration as referrals and needed a lot of them to fill their pipeline. They focused on keeping their businesses viable. Vetting for these owners meant trust. Would a referred business contact their clients quickly and conduct themselves properly? They expected the other business to refer them as well. These businesses were willing to pay $50-$100 per month for a dependable networking platform and wanted warm leads.

          We had two different user types with differing frustrations based on their goals and attitudes towards collaboration. Yet the overall areas of concern were the same. Both users were interested in connecting with the right people for their needs. They were both strapped for time and needed to connect with others efficiently. We developed our problem statement based on the similarities between them.
        </p>
        <p class='semi-bold'>
          Digital networking platforms save time, but the connections are not high in quality. Bad collaborations can damage reputations, destroy brands and cripple the bottom line. Resource-strapped businesses need a way to vet partners so they can reach objectives.

            Moving into ideation we knew our solution would have to address the user’s differences. I personally love challenges like this. How would we create a single concept that helped both users in their quest for quality connections? We needed to keep our personas in mind as we developed a cohesive concept. If an idea could not be beneficial to both of the personas as well as the client, it was insufficient.

          We developed three divergent concepts to test. Each concept incorporated some of the features we brainstormed. Our client supplied us with five small business owners to test from various industry backgrounds. The testers were shown each concept and asked to think aloud describing what tasks they could perform and how they felt about those tasks. Moderators controlled the flow users were shown to limit the focus to the concept and not the interaction.

              We tested profile reviews and a collaboration project application feature. This concept focused heavily on the business profile which was aimed at our strategy-minded persona. I thought it displayed the information gathered during onboarding in a thoughtful and clear manner. It demonstrated the payoff for a user who invested the time to complete the onboarding process well.

            After synthesizing all of our insights we could start making recommendations. We looked at what each of the personas wanted. How were their wants similar and how were they divergent? What path could we develop to increase the user base and monetize it?

              <h3 class='semi-bold'>1. Exclusive Referrals</h3>
              <p>
                Focus on an exclusive referral group which limits membership of similar businesses adds value.

              <h3 class='semi-bold'>2. Quick Referral Share</h3>
              <p>
                Time is money. Make sure it’s quick and easy to refer others. Fast referrals will keep users engaged with the platform.

              <p>
                Strategy-minded users do a lot of research. Keep them engaged by offering as much information as possible within Collaborate.biz.

            <div class='recommendation col-lg-6'>
              <h3 class='semi-bold'>4. Two Match Types</h3>
              <p>
                Users need to input match requirements for the two different collaboration types. Inputs and outputs may be different. Show which type a matched business falls under.

            <span class='semi-bold'>During user interviews we discovered that users were looking for steady referrals.</span>
            Members of competitors like BNI are the only member in the group to offer their product or service. That generates more and better leads.
          </p>
          <p>
            A personal chef would receive referrals from all others in their group for catering. It’s as close to a guaranteed number of referrals as one could get. Exclusivity coupled with warm leads and a tracking feature would attract users who would pay for such features. That income would help Collaborate.biz become platform it aspired to be.

          Collaborate.biz was onboard. Our client was willing to walk down this path with us and see where it led. Then midway through finalizing our final concept, the client found refer.com.

        </div>
        <p>
          <span class='semi-bold'>At first glance, refer.com was exactly what we planned on building.</span>
          The product is clean, friendly and professional. It incorporates referral teams and reminders. Their Engage Pro subscription offers referral tracking, message builders and more. The price point is $49 per month. Right in line with the $50-$100 monthly price our users said they’d be willing to pay.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had less than a week left in our timeframe. We took a minute to gather our thoughts and reviewed refer.com to determine how it related to our recommendations for Collaborate.biz.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class='semi-bold'>While our MVP would be similar to refer.com we didn’t consider it a product ending threat because the referral component of the product was only half of the picture. We were focusing on referrals to fund the development of the collaboration platform.</span>
          Our proposed MVP integrated a robust profile which strategy-minded users would be interested in. If the profiles were robust enough, strategic users could treat Collaborate.biz as the go to source for vetting information. Once that was established, the client could focus on researching and developing the collaboration components.

            Our final design featured a landing page to better describe Collaborate.biz's purpose. Users wanted to see statistics on active users and points that highlight successes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We simplified on boarding giving detailed reasons for the information. After supplying the basic information users could continue without finishing. Dot navigation indicates how far a user is in the on boarding process.

          <p>
            The referral process starts with an email to the referred business. After acceptance the end client receives an email introducing the referred business. The status of this flow is accessible from the referral log page.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Having reviewed the feedback from users, analyzed the competitive landscape and listened to our recommendations, the client decided change direction. In the end, this project became a practice in validating or invalidating a current product state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back I learned a lot. I learned the importance of outlining the UX process in depth with clients in the first meeting. I learned the importance of conducting extra competitive analysis after ideating and how to work with a decisive client who has definite ideas about the product and how it should be positioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a design standpoint, I learned how effective and time saving it is to work as a group to outline the large elements of a page. We can together to flesh out the overall placement and function of elements before diverging to get the prototype finished. I used this practice in my final project at DESIGNATION and it helped us acheive a cohesive end result.
