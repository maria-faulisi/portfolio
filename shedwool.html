            ShedWool is an app born out of necessity when our client’s employer decided to stop using a similar app because of cost constraints. Most apps that solve for shift scheduling issues are subscription based. ShedWool is different because it is a free app that relies on ad revenue. This opens the platform up to small and large companies alike. Prior to apps like ShedWool, shift work employees and their managers had to create schedules the “old school” way. Tracking shifts using spreadsheets, paper print-outs with written corrections, Post-it notes with requests and planner “books” for future requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            When DESIGNATION was approached, ShedWool had already been available on iTunes and Google Play for five months.The client wanted to simplify its interface and emulate apps he enjoyed, like Twitter and Snapchat. The working version was built on wireframes he drew himself and featured functionality inspired by apps he used as an employee of a major Chicago restaurant chain. He realized he had to make ShedWool stand on its own.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s where we came in. We were asked to talk with users and identify areas of improvement. The scope and focus area were up to us, but we were asked to target restaurant employees as the primary users. I was excited to work on an app that was already in the market, had users and was more robust than an MVP.

            As we developed our test plan I walked through some of the tasks we intended to ask of the users. While I had never worked in a restaurant, or managed a team of shift work employees myself, I assumed I could navigate the app without issue. I was surprised to find that I was confused by the schedule view and the concept of shift blocks. Our tests integrated each of our assumptions. My assumption was that users would want to see a calendar view of some kind.

                We tested five people from the restaurant industry, two managers and three waitstaff. Using the current app we asked users to complete a simple series of tasks. For management, we asked them to add a new employee, schedule that new employee and check the staff coverage for Valentine’s Day. For employees, we asked them to find the next day and time they were working, pick up a shift and request time off for a specific day. At the end of testing we asked retrospective questions around the overall function and expectations of the app.

          The testing helped us validate some of our assumptions and uncover basic issues users had with the overall app. My assumption about the calendar view was validated; however shift blocks were commonplace for managers and were not an area of concern. We were ready for some in depth interviews.

          <p>
            We spoke with four managers and five employees. Our questions for management focused around building schedules, common issues or pain points and specific app usage. Questions for employees focused on how they communicated their scheduling needs to managers, managed changes and general attitudes on the scheduling process. The interviews gave us a solid understanding of the shift schedule lifespan.

              Managers were stressed early in the schedule lifecycle but they had ways to manage the situation. Typically, managers created set schedules for their long term career servers. It was the part-time staff they had to worry about and after schedules were made, they placed responsibility of finding scheduling changes on the servers.

                For employees, finding resolutions to scheduling conflicts meant reaching out to one another and negotiating. Interviewees said negotiating in person during work was the best way to handle this. Face to face communication while at work allowed employees to review the most current version of the schedule, negotiate a swap and gain management approval quickly.

                From my previous projects I had come to love concept testing as a great way to get early feedback on rough ideas. We spent one of our three weeks testing the current product and interviewing users. We agreed as a team to spend the second week testing concepts and refining them. We didn’t want to take a lot of valuable time crafting clickable prototypes and focusing heavily on interactions. During this week we went through three rounds of concept testing. Each round built on the previous and introduced a new flow.

                For our first round of testing we focused on the shift schedule view. This would be the default screen a user saw after logging in, and it was the primary starting point for all shift action flows. This was also the best time to introduce our various navigation styles so we had plenty of time to iterate.

              Many rounds of concept testing helped us solidify the areas we should focus on and how they should be presented. We busied ourselves with combining the best of what worked.

              The final prototype integrates a week view, and allows users to initiate all shift actions from the schedule view. It displays available pickup shifts within the week view and integrates all actions from the shift itself. The time off page is clean and features a large CTA for new requests.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we ended our final days of the project, we tested the prototype to gauge its effectiveness. We tested two random users and made quick fixes before testing the final three. We asked prototype testers to complete the major employee shift actions.

              The current app didn’t have swap shift functionality. Testers enjoyed it and found it easy to use.

              Overall, I think the app would benefit from more testing of the schedule week view interaction. I’d suggest using real data from a few user schedules to make sure the space required is sufficient. Currently, the week view is tidy having only a single shift scheduled. But from the user interviews I know that there are edge cases where double shifts and open ended shifts are normal considerations. Once the employee side has been finalized, focusing on the manager side of the same interactions would be a natural next step in UX design and development.

          My final project with DESIGNATION was a positive one. I integrated lessons learned about concept testing and working as a team to draw out pages. Iterating using a fast and loose methodology positively affected our final concept. We were able to get to a cleaner better interaction without wasting a lot of time. Getting the concepts pinned down faster allowed my team to test more often and with greater impact.

          The client was happy with the progress we made. He felt that the interface we designed was visibly and functionally better than his competitors and from his current app which was based on those competitors. He felt that his app was overly complex and built using an engineer’s mindset. It was logical, but didn’t focus on usability. The final wireframes are cleaner and focus on minimizing the number of views. While the design itself does not look like the apps he wished to emulate, the changes made are at the heart of what he wanted most.
